# Monetary Policy and the Pandemic  
### SVAR Analysis of Monetary Policy in the COVID-19 Era

This repository contains the code and materials for my final dissertation for the Double Degree in Economics and Statistics.

The project studies the effectiveness of monetary policy before, during, and after COVID-19 in the euro area and the United States using Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) models with sign restrictions, grounded in a New Keynesian framework.

## Research Goals

- Evaluate how monetary policy transmission changed across periods:
  - Pre-COVID
  - COVID crisis
  - Post-COVID
- Compare responses between the euro area and the United States
- Identify and interpret structural monetary policy shocks
- Measure effects on:
  - Overnight interest rates
  - Inflation
  - Output gap

## Methodology

- Reduced-form Bayesian VAR estimation
- Independent normal–Wishart priors
- Structural identification via sign restrictions
- Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)
- Historical Decompositions (HDs)
- Time-series preprocessing and stationarity analysis
